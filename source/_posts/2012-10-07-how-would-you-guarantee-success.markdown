Today, I started reviewing Lesson 2 by reading the summaries. The goal of this class is to visualize what success looks like
and identify steps to get there.

Success is boring and doesn't have to rely on heroic acts (or wait for inspiration to strike).

Successful products have these ingredients:

**Sells well (sales guaranteed).**

* Observe what your customers do.
* Ask the Five Why's.
* Identify needs before setting out to build your product.
* "Mine the pain." Look for an underserved subgroup of customers for an existing product.
* "Bait the hook to suit the fish." Speak the customer's language.

**Makes customers happy.**

* Humanize (add a human touch to your product).
* Match customers with the value that my product provides.
* "It's not about you."
* Make customers feel special through product previews (invite-only).

**Keeps us (creators) motivated.**

* Set goals (destination)
* Identify action steps (map)
* Review goals (waypoints/milestones); break down large tasks
* Timebox tasks

**Maintains creative freedom.**

* Comfortable using a medium (e.g. desktop, mobile, web)
* Doesn't require external capital (e.g. VCs, angel investors)
* Be able to "fire" customers when necessary
* Avoid products with long sales cycles or frequent tweaks

**Allows you to live the life the way you want.**

* Pick products de-coupled from time and location; within my skills
* Less disciplined work habits translate to less personal freedom
* Serve my customers while keeping my awesome day job

**Earns a good profit.**

* Be able to price the product appropriately
* Do not undersell/compete on costs
* Generates enough surplus
* Serve "price-blind" customers (e.g. sell coffee at airports)
* Sell to "hungry" customers with money to spend
* Focus on value (what they get); produce high-value features

** Growth is controlled.**

* Do not pursue "growth for growth's sake"
* Raise prices; features should match what people need
* Serve a tiny audience
* Build infoproducts (vs. software) where upkeep is not proportional to growth
