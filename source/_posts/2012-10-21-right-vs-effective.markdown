<blockquote>The key for me is to learn the techniques from those who have been at it longer (thus this class)
and then practice, carefully and consciously and consistently, over and over again until the thing
I am working on (a product, a business, a lifestyle) is as good as I want it to be. If that happens
then I can start over again with something else.</blockquote>
