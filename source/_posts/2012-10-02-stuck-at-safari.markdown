While looking at my time log, I noticed I only spent 5:45 on 30x500 last month. Given that it was a busy month,
I usually find a way to sneak 15 minutes here or there on Safari (learning more about my Audience).

I've been resisting to move forward and to write pitches (to date, I have only written one pitch). Steven Pressfield calls this
The Resistance, the opposing force that prevents people from doing their greatest work.

This blog will be my companion as I go through this class and my way of giving my Resistance the finger.
