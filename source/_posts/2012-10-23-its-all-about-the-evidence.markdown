<blockquote>Over and over, no matter how crazy or how simple, the prof challenged Dan to design
experiments and collect his own real-world, actual evidence. 

As I was taking notes on the microfail video, Amy's take on "real explanations" nagged at my brain.
Today as I was reviewing and rethinking it, it clicked: it's all about evidence. Real explanations,
collecting data in the Sales Safari, A/B testing... in fact I think I may have unlocked a cornerstone
of Amy's worldview here--she recently told a student "what are the facts, you can't 'logic' your way
to your desired conclusion". :-)</blockquote>>
