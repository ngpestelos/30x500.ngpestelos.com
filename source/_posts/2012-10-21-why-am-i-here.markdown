While catching up with the Winter 2012 forum, I found that my classmates are sharing why they took the
class.

## My answers:

### Why am I here?

After one startup and a failed bootstrapped project, I've had enough of ideas.

### Why now?

While I'm still young and able and relatively free of obligations (I have no one else to blame but myself).

### What do you hope to achieve?

1. To learn how to create products that I could sell. Also, to be able to price my products
appropriately in order to make a good surplus for myself. Having an alternative revenue source means I can
be less dependent on a job.

2. To better experience at life. I define better as being able to live my life not just making a living,
but doing meaningful work.

## Emerging Themes

* being in control
* spending more time with family
* develop products people want to pay for
* income source not tied to a specific location
* building assets vs trading time for money
